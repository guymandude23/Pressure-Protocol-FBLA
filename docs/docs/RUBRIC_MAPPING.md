# Rubric Mapping — Pressure Protocol

This document explains how Pressure Protocol satisfies the FBLA Game & Simulation Programming rubric.

## Defined Navigation

Players can move freely in the 2D environment using WASD controls.
Each career begins with a rules screen explaining objectives, scoring, and pressure mechanics.

## Multiple Outcomes

Simulations do not end in simple win or lose.
Possible outcomes include:

- Perfect Performance
- Strong Performance
- Managed Performance
- Struggle
- Failure

Outcomes are based on cumulative pressure and decision quality.

## Challenge Level

Each career contains three difficulty modes:

Easy — Guided experience  
Medium — Analytical decision making  
Hard — Random events and rapid pressure escalation  

## Realistic Simulation

Early mistakes affect later performance through a cumulative stress system.
The game models burnout and mental strain rather than isolated decision scoring.

## Feedback System

The pressure meter provides real-time feedback and directly impacts pacing, difficulty, and final evaluation.
